To deploy your webpage, we'll be using a tool called Get Forge (https://getforge.com/). It's a great tool
for launching your webpage onto the internet.

When you're happy with how your site looks, and you've tested it on different screen sizes and browsers, you're ready to deploy.

### Sign up for GetForge

- [ ] Navigate to https://getforge.com/ and sign up for an account


### Create your site

When you log into your GetForge account, you should see a screen like this:

- [ ] Edit the input at the bottom to customize your site's URL
- [ ] Click **Create Site**

### Zip up your Project

In order to upload your project to GetForge, you need to zip the folder into a file.

To zip a file on a Mac:

- [ ] Find your project folder in Finder
- [ ] Right-click on your folder, and select **Compress**

### Upload Zip

Back on the GetForge website, click the **Upload ZIP** button.

Then, navigate to the URL that you customized earlier. You should see your site at that address!


#### Congrats! You've just launched a website!
