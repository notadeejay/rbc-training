## What is programming?

When you're writing code, you're writing instructions for your computer to follow, similar to what you might do when writing a recipe for a friend or asking for a favour. When we communicate with each other, however, we rely on a lot of context. Imagine someone sent you this text message:

> Can you make me a cup of tee?

Even though they made a spelling error, as a thinking human being, you know that what they meant to say is *tea*. Computers can't do that â€“ when we communicate instructions to computers, we have to be **very, very specific**.

Assuming we could send this message to a computer, in its logic it might respond by telling you it doesn't know what "tee" is, or it might make you a cup containing a single golf tee. In either case, that's not what you want!

## Writing Code

For today's exercises we're going to be writing our code in the browser. To start, go to repl.it (<https://repl.it/languages/javascript>). You can sign up using a GitHub or Google account if you would like to save your work from day to day. Since we're only going to be using this app this week, you can also choose not to save your work by closing the pop up.

As you can see, you can write your code in the white panel on the left. Click the **Run** button to see the output of your code on the right.

## Tips & Tricks

#### console.log

In JavaScript, if we want to print something to the screen (also known as the console) we use the `console.log` function. For example, if Maggie wants to see her name printed to the screen, she could do the following:

```javascript
console.log("Maggie")
```

#### Errors

If you make a mistake, JavaScript will do its best to help you out. For example, if you forget to add a closing `)` bracket on the above code, you will get an error message like this one:

![error message example](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/0A230t2j1p3Z2D462B1z/%5B64d0ffd99e5671f7bd69ce1cd84cf237%5D_Image+2017-09-04+at+11.23.54+AM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=2818368&v=afeeafa6)

One of the hardest parts of learning a programming language is deciphering the error messages. Do your best to read them though, as they contain helpful hints and often point you in the right direction to fix your code.

#### Comments

In JavaScript, anything after two slashes (`//`) is a comment. This means that the computer will just skip right over them. Comments are for *you*, the developer, not your computer. They're a handy way to add notes in your code, for your future self or for other developers.

#### Bugs

If you hang around developers long enough, chances are you'll hear someone say something like:

> I found another bug in my program.

> Ugh. This is so buggy!

> Just squashed another bug!

When you hear a developer talk about a bug, they're usually referring to a mistake in the code that leads to unintended consequences. If you ever noticed a website or app "breaking" while you're using it, you've encountered a bug. Working to fix these issues is therefore commonly known as "debugging" your code.
