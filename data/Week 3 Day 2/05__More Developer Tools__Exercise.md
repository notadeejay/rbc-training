Before we deploy our web page to the world, we want to take a minute to test it. We need a way to make sure our app looks great across a variety of devices. This can be a difficult task when, chances are, you don't own a wide variety of devices.

Luckily, most browsers have a set of tools you can use that mimic what your site would look like on mobile phones, tablets, etc.


### Tasks
- [ ] Use Chrome Dev Tools to see how your web page looks on different devices
- [ ] Make a list of styling issues you find (are components squished? Is some content hidden on a smaller screen)

### Tips & Tricks
