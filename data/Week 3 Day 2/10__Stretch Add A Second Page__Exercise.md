  Explain how you can add a second webpage to a static site
  - Give them suggestions for what to add
  - Explain how to reuse styles between the two pages
-->

Most websites you've visited, probably had a more than one page to display. We can do this with static sites.


We can add links to other pages on our site using **relative paths**.


```html
  <a href="./about.html">About Page</a>
```

### Tasks

- [ ] Create a second html file in your project folder
- [ ] Add a basic HTML skeleton to your page, and link your `styles.css` file
- [ ] In your `index.html`, add a link to your second page.
- [ ] Add content to your second HTML page

### Tips & Tricks

Try adding a page to show off some projects you've worked on, or a list of your favourite
blogs, podcasts or tv shows.

Or, add a page to show off all of your awesome web development projects.
