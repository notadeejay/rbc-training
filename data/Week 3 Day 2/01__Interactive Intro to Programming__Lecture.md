## Objectives

By the end of this class, you should be able to:
- Use console.log to print something to the screen
- Add integers and strings and console.log the results
- Declare a variable
- Write if statements
- Understand the basic anatomy of a function



So far, our classes have followed the same format: An hour lecture, followed by some time for working on your project. Today is going to go a _little_ bit differently. Instead of the usual, you'll be introduced a new JavaScript concept, and then we'll write some code together as a group. We will go through each concept one by one, and you will have some time to follow along with the lecture and to work on mini challenges!

Let's get started!

## Teacher Notes

- Go slowly and make sure you mention common mistakes or syntax errors.
- Demonstrate what an error message looks like
- Ask Questions as you go to make sure they are on board with what you're saying.

The format of this lecture is a shift from the typical day - each concept we introduce has 'mini challenges' associated with it.
The best way to deliver this lecture is to introduce a concept - let them try it out, and once everyone is comfortable, move along to the next one.

## Things to Cover

Introduce them to the following fundamental concepts of programming:

- Comments
- Integers
- Strings
- Booleans
- Variables
- If Statements
- Functions

## Out of Scope

- Arrays, Objects and Loops
- These will be covered at a later date
