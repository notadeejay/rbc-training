Do a quick review of everything we've learned throughout the course.

Discuss next steps and other resources where they can learn to code.

Ask students what they would like to learn in the earlier weeks, and do a specialized lecture?

- Deploy JQuery Projects
- Do a small demo day
- Cover any extra questions or things they wanted to know


- Should we also give them resources on how to use front end frameworks?
<!--
Should we introduce github? A place where they can keep their projects
 -->
