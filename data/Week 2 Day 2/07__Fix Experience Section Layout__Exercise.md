Let's move on to the experience section. First, let's take a second and notice
that we want all of our experience entries to **share** styles. When you notice shared
styles between elements, it's often a good indication that you can use a **class** for this.

To start adjusting the layout of our experience section:

- [ ] Add class to each `div` that contains the **date** and **job title**
  - **Tip**: Try to choose something descriptive. Avoid class names like 'element', 'container-1', etc.
- [ ] Style your new class to have a display property of flex

- [ ] Add a class name to the `div` that contains the **company name** and **job description**
- [ ] Style your new class to have a display property of flex (Is there anywhere in your CSS code you can prevent writing a whole other CSS block for this?)


After adding those CSS styles, your **Experience** section should look something like this:

It looks, well, a littlebitsquished.

What CSS styles can we add to fix that?
