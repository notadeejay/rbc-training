The footer is the last section to adjust the layout in. We're going to add styles quite similar
to the ones we used in the `header`.


## Tasks

- [ ] Add the flex display property to the footer


## Refactoring

You can think of refactoring like when you edit the rough draft of an essay, except of course
for your code. Go through your CSS and see if you can find any places where you can share code between
styles, add a class or simply remove duplicate styles.

Better yet, grab a friend and clean up your code together!

Don't forget to watch for proper indentation :)
