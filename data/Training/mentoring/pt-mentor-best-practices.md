# Mentor Best Practices

**Be Familiar With The Instructions**

Read through the day’s assignment before coming to class. It takes 5 minutes and makes debugging the project so much easier. Plus, when students ask _‘Does this look right?’, you’ve got a better answer.

**Be Approachable**

Sometimes there are stretches in between questions. Do your best to walk around the room and continue to check-in with students. See someone staring at their screen in frustration? A simple 'How are things going It’s easy to grab your phone or laptop and check your email, texts, or whatever. But if you have to do this, make it quick and make sure you stay open and approachable.

Some students are shy and may not want to interrupt you. If no one has any questions for a long time, take a walk around the room and check-in. A simple 'How are things going over here?' can go a long way. For whatever reason, some people won’t ask if you’re sitting at the front - but they’ll ask if you just happen to be right next to them.

**Let Them Type**

Let the student write the code. It can be frustrating to watch someone type slowly, or struggle to right click - but they get so much more out of it when they do it themselves.

**Be Encouraging**

It’s easy to forget how confusing some of these concepts are when you use them day in, day out as a developer. Try to step back and see how the code or the issue looks to the student. Even asking them to explain it to you can be helpful in finding the gaps in their knowledge or understanding.

**Ask For Help**

If you can’t figure out what the problem is within 10 minutes, grab another mentor. Sometimes you just need a fresh pair of eyes. Spending an hour on a bug someone else could have gotten in five minutes cuts into the time the student has to work on their project. Plus, you learn something new too, so next time the issue comes up, you’ll be ready to help the student solve it.


**It’s the Little Things**

Sometimes, the littlest things have the biggest impact. Some students are a little bit intimidated by code, and learning so much every week. Doing your best to remember students names, and ask them how their week is going when they come in for class can help establish a friendly and supportive atmosphere. Remember that for many students, signing up for this course is a **big** step outside of their comfort zone.
