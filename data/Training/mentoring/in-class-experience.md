# The In-Class Experience

Up until Day One our part-time students have only interacted with the Lighthouse Labs admissions staff. They’ve been briefed on what to expect, given access to Compass, Slack and equipped with all the right tools and now we are handing them off to you, our trusted instructor, for the next 6 weeks.

So what should they expect? Curriculum is only one part of the magic that makes a great part-time course experience, the rest - we’ve outlined below.

## Day One

 1. A member of Lighthouse Labs staff will be present to set up the room, to greet students at the front desk / reception area, provide them with a name tag and direct them to the classroom
 2. Please welcome students to the classroom and help them get settled in. Maybe set them up on the WiFi while you’re waiting for everyone to arrive.
 3. The goal of day one is to get students comfortable with one another and feel like they ended the class making at least one friend, so…
 4. **The Ice Breaker activity:**
 	 - Students will be handed slips of paper with random questions on them (provided by Lighthouse Staff)
	 - Ask students to spend 5 minutes introducing themselves to the person next to them including:
		 - Their name, what they do and why they are taking this course
		 - Answering one question from the slips of paper
	- After 5 minutes, everyone can return to the larger group. Ask each student to introduce themselves to the class and tell us one thing they learned about the person next to them. Continue until all students have introduced themselves.
 5.  Kick off lecture!

## Daily Check In

Each day when your students have arrived you should do a short exercise. Ask each student to go around the room and answer: **“What are you the most confused about after last class?”**

If there appears to be a trend in the gaps in understanding please document these and translate them into Github issues for the respective lesson.

These short activities are meant to increase social engagement in the classroom and get students used to acknowledging the things that they are struggling with. It will also give you, the instructor, a sense of where there may have been some gaps in your previous lesson for the next cohort or to incorporate certain topics into the review for that day

## Last Day

 - A Lighthouse Labs staff member will be present to welcome students to their last day in class and facilitate the filling out of the feedback survey (now integrated into Compass)
 - They will also and out certificates, t-shirts & ducks
 - Students will do a short (~3 minutes) presentation of their project to the class (Mini Demo Day, yay!)
 - This day is left fairly open to accommodate anything students would like to learn more of before demoing their projects
 - What should students focus on when demoing?
	 - Why they selected the particular project
	 - What their favourite part of the project was
	 - An additional feature they would like to incorporate into their app (stretch) -
 - Some potential last day scenarios include:
	 - If the class is too large for there to be sufficient time to demo projects:
		 - Split the class into smaller groups and have them
	 - If the students have not finished their project and/or deployed them:
		 - If any students would like to demo what they've made thus far, they can do so locally
		 - Give students time to finish up their applications or help with deployment and only demo a select few
