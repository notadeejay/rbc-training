# Instructing and Mentoring Best Practices

In delivering the Fundamentals courses at Lighthouse Labs, there are a few key points that should be kept in mind when deciding on your approach for education delivery in the role of either Mentor or Instructor.

**1. In comparison to the participants, you are immensely skilled and knowledgeable**
  
  One of the most common pieces of feedback we get when we invite people to mentor and instruct our Fundamentals courses is, “Do you think I know enough?” This is common imposter syndrome, of course, but it also gives us an opportunity to highlight the difference in knowledge and skill that you bring to the class versus what the average participant is bringing. 

  It should also be noted that your knowledge of the material needs to be far greater than the people taking the class. This means that as a mentor and instructor, you need to know not only what today’s material is, but how it relates to later parts of the course. A lot of your role is putting a task into context. Being able to answer that all important “Why am I doing this?” question for the people you help is a critical skill you need to bring to this opportunity.

**2. The demands of these classes are far lower than the demands of the bootcamp program**

  While most of our mentors and instructors are alumni of the bootcamp courses, it should be reminded that the bootcamp environment is much more intense, not just in the schedule but also in the rigour of the work. 

  That isn’t to say that our participants are not going to work hard. For most of them, this will seem like the bootcamp did to you, based on level of skill and familiarity with technology. One trap that prior mentors and instructors have fallen into is saying things like “Oh, it was WAAAY harder in bootcamp!” or “A real dev works twice as hard as this all the time.” Both of those statements demean the effort our participants are putting in. Reassurance is worth more than comparison/contrast. Let them know that even though it’s hard, they’re going to get it.

**3. Your primary role is to help build skills in the participants, and help them to overcome any personal obstacles to their learning**

  Most of the participants of the Fundamentals programs have never done much (or any) coding before. As a result, they are still experiencing that awkward stage that you went through when you were first building the muscle memory of typing curly braces, understanding the intricacies of angle brackets, and asking those all-important “Why” questions. 

  Try and make each person feel like they are smarter when they leave the room at the end of class than they were when they arrived. Work on deconstructing the problems into attainable chunks, and identifying what concept is blocking the understanding from occurring. These are all problems you have solved before, so knowing the material means you are likely to have identified the “gotcha” moments in the curriculum.

**4. The Fundamentals classes are not part of a “sales funnel” to get students into the bootcamp**

  If it works out that a participant in the Fundamentals courses demonstrates the necessary skills, passion, and grit that would mark them for success in the bootcamp, that is fantastic and we want to nurture their interest. Our greater developer community will benefit from more passionate people. 

  However, at no point should participants feel that we are “pushing” the bootcamp program on them. They have chosen to take a different path and are likely intimidated by the level of tech in this course. 

**5. You should always answer questions with some extra context to the solution you have provided**

  Even if it is just a sentence or two which helps to illuminate the participant’s understanding of the issue, always try and leave each request for assistance having passed on some insight and extra context to the person who asked. This is why we call you “mentors” instead of “TAs”. Mentors share knowledge, build skills, and pass on wisdom. They allow the people they help to leap ahead in their learning, bypassing a lot of the trial and error and hard knocks that others had to go through to learn the content manually, without guidance. 

**6. The participant is there to do the work themselves. Examples and corrections should always be done on your own computer.**

  Unless the issue is a complicated DevOps issue that requires hands-on, command line intervention, there should be no reason that you would ever need to take over a participant’s computer. One piece of feedback we get regularly is how much people learn from watching developers work in their native environment. Seeing you use YOUR editor teaches them, so always offer examples or corrections on your own screen, instead of changing what is on theirs. It is important to their learning that they maintain control of the input of the code on their machine.

**7. There is no one “right way” to deliver the lecture content**

  Trying to fit how you want to explain things into a mold of what someone else has done before is unreasonable. Being inspired by someone else’s delivery methods is advisable, even recommended. However, don’t think that because Person X did the lecture a particular way previously that you are required to do it that exact same way. Feel free to deliver the material in a way that you feel comfortable, making sure that you have achieved all of the key learning objectives. 

  This may mean using your own slides, changing images, and using different examples than what is prescribed in the Teachers Notes. What is most important is that at the end of YOUR lecture, the students are coming away with the same or better understanding as what students would have had with the previous method. Innovation in education delivery is the hallmark of the bootcamp model. We encourage it. We wouldn’t have put you in the role of instructor if all we needed was a parrot!

**8. Demonstration of a concept is often more powerful than explanation of a concept**

  Usually, you will explain a concept first to someone (or a class), and then afterwards demonstrate it for them. The explanation paved the way for the demonstration, but it is the practical application of the concept which is going to be most impactful for most participants. This mentality and approach applies to both lecturers and mentors, as the situation is going to occur in both cases.

  Analogies are one of the most powerful tools you have for being able to create understanding in participants. When explaining algorithms, reference a recipe. When discussing protocols, talk about the “rules of the road” that we all follow when driving. When teaching someone HTML, reference the framing of a house. Use everyday analogies that will allow the participant to draw connections in their mind with the concept you are trying to share with them. Most mental obstacles are built on the foundation that “It’s tech, so it must be hard to understand” and we know that it simply isn’t true. Well, not always, anyway. 

**9. Finding something to praise in what a participant contributes is often the difference between them trying harder and giving up**

  When someone asks a question, shows some code (even if it’s not working), or tries to explain a problem, it is an incredibly effective tool to start off by praising the parts that they have gotten right, or that are approaching success. A class setting such as our Fundamentals courses is often a humbling environment, and our positive support allows them to feel confidence. This is not to say that you have to be unnecessarily positive and struggle to find things, but if there is something you can find to praise, it is often incredibly encouraging to our participants. Even something small, such as indentation, syntax, or getting started in the right direction can give them the confidence they need to keep working to understand the material. Celebrating success with a well-timed high five is a great way to boost morale. 

**10. Your attitude directly influences their work ethic and desire to participate**

  Your morale informs theirs. It’s the end of a long day, and now you have a three hour class to get through. If you hear someone ask why you have to use semicolons one more time, you’re going to snap! Unfortunately, that mentality and approach will be written on your face and broadcast in your body language. You’re going to be the mentor or instructor that sours the mood of the room. Shake it off before you come in. Read a joke, have a glass of water, get your head into the right space. Your role is one of educator, mentor, instructor, and leader. If you can demonstrate a positive attitude towards the material, then your students will too. You have the capacity to make their experience unforgettably good, or regrettable. 

**11. Be Familiar With The Instructions**

  Read through the day’s assignment before coming to class. It takes 5 minutes and makes debugging the project so much easier. Plus, when students ask ‘Does this look right?’, you’ve got a better answer.

**12. Let Them Type**

  Let the student write the code. It can be frustrating to watch someone type slowly, or struggle to right click - but they get so much more out of it when they do it themselves. 

**13. Ask For Help**

  If you can’t figure out what the problem is within 10 minutes, grab another mentor. Sometimes you just need a fresh pair of eyes. Spending an hour on a bug someone else could have gotten in five minutes cuts into the time the student has to work on their project. Plus, you learn something new too, so next time the issue comes up, you’ll be ready to help the student solve it. 

**14. Be Encouraging**

  It’s easy to forget how confusing some of these concepts are when you use them day in, day out as a developer. Try to step back and see how the code or the issue looks to the student. Even asking them to explain it to you can be helpful in finding the gaps in their knowledge or understanding.

**15. Be Approachable**
  Sometimes there are stretches in between questions. It’s easy to grab your phone or laptop and check your email, texts, or whatever. But if you have to do this, make it quick and make sure you stay open and approachable. 

  Some students are shy and may not want to interrupt you. If no one has any questions for a long time, take a walk around the room. For whatever reason, some people won’t ask if you’re sitting at the front - but they’ll ask if you just happen to be right next to them. 

**16. It’s the Little Things**

  Sometimes, the littlest things have the biggest impact. Some students are a little bit intimidated by code, and learning so much every week. Doing your best to remember students names, and ask them how their week is going when they come in for class can help establish a friendly and supportive atmosphere. Remember that for many students, signing up for this course is a big step outside of their comfort zone.
