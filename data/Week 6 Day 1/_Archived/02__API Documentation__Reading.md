 Talk about how each API has documentation
 you can read to learn how to use it
 - Write the documentation to let them complete the day's exercise without
 scrolling through the documentation

<<<<<<< HEAD
Today we'll be continuing to work on our jQuery projects. Most APIs have **documentation**. Documentation describes how to use the API, and often provides instructions on how to get started and some examples.

Both the **Weather API**, the **Horoscope API**, and the **Drink API** have additional endpoints we can send GET requests to.

### 5 day forecast

Knowing what the weather is going to be like today is one thing, but knowing how to pack for your vacation to a new city is another. We'll add the ability to search for a five day forecast to your Weather app.


### Horoscopes, future and past

The horoscope API we've been using also allows you to search for yesterday's or tomorrow's horoscopes. We'll use this to our advantage to add additional functionality to our app.

### Drinks, by ingredient

For our drink app we'll add the option to search for a drink based on ingredients. Pretty helpful, right?
