So far, we're sending GET requests to our API and getting the correct response. But our page is still displaying the information from our example responses.

## Tasks

- [ ] Refactor your code to display the information returned in your GET request
- [ ] Delete the example response from the top of your file


## Tips & Tricks

- Go slowly, start by just displaying one property from the GET request before moving on to the others
- Keep an eye out for places where you might be repeating yourself (see if there's a way you can re-use a function, or another way to DRY up your code).
- Ask for help if and when you need it, that's what your mentors are here for.
