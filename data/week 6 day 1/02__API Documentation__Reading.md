 Talk about how each API has documentation
 you can read to learn how to use it
 - Write the documentation to let them complete the day's exercise without
 scrolling through the documentation
  -->

Today we'll be continuing to work on our JQuery projects. Most API's have **documentation**. Documenttion describes how to use the API, and often provides

Both the **Weather API** and the **Pokemon API** have additional endpoints we could
send GET requests to.
