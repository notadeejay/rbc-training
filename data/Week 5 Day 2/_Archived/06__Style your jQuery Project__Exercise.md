If you've been styling your jQuery project as you went along, great! If not, now's the time to put your CSS knowledge to work.

## Tasks

- Add styles, a custom font and a fun colour scheme to your jQuery project. You can even add animations and some transitions to your project.

Next class you'll be demoing your project to the group. So go crazy :)
