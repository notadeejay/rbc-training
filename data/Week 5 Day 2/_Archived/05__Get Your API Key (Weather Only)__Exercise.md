In order to use some APIs, you first need to get an API key. This API key is associated with a particular account, and basically tells the API server you're sending requests to: "Hey, I'm allowed to send you requests".

To use the Weather API we've picked out for you, you'll have to sign up for an account and find your API key in your dashboard.

## Tasks

- Create an account at <https://home.openweathermap.org>
- Under the **My Home** section, click the **API Keys** tab
- Copy your API key
- Declare a variable at the top of your `index.js` file and assign it to your API key
