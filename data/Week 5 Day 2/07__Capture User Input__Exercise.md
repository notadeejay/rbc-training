Next class we'll be taking the user input, and using it to send a request to a server. To prepare for that,
we're going to start by logging out the user input to our console.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add code so when the user clicks 'search' the content of the input is logged to the console


## Tips and Tricks

### val

Will return the value of an element

```javascript
  $('p').val()
```

### console.log

Will print a value to the console

```javascript
  console.log("Hello World")
```
