All three of the jQuery app options let users search for some information from an outside source. Next class, we'll learn all about how to implement this in jQuery.

For today, we've created two JavaScript objects that mimic the responses you will get from the APIs.

Go through these two sample responses, and take note of the information provided. What information would you like to display to your users?

## Horoscope app response

```javascript
{
  "horoscope":"Time to reconnect with your roots? From now until February 17, curious Mercury is spinning through Aquarius, activating your fourth house of home and family. Pore over old photos, take an ancestry DNA test or add comfy new touches to your decor. Make it a priority to nurture your most cherished ties with regular (or reinvigorated) communication. Don't worry about how much time has passedâ€”just pick up wherever you are and you'll fill each other in on the stuff that matters. Women in particular can play an important role. Be receptive to advice from the savvy sisterhood.",
  "date":"Thursday, February 1, 2018",
  "sign":"scorpio"
}
```

## Weather app response
```javascript

  base: "stations",

      main: "Clear"
    }
  ],
  wind: {
    deg: 170,
    speed: 1.5
  }

}
```

## Tasks

- Copy and paste the object for your respective project to the **top** of your `index.js` file

You will use this data in today's exercises.

## Tips & Tricks

## Objects Review

Objects are made up of key value pairs. The values can be set to any data type, even other objects.

```javascript
var order = {
  items: [
    {
      name: 't-shirt',
      price: 10
    },
    {
      name: 'shoes',
      price: 30
    }
  ],
  orderId: 12345,
  shipping: {
    address: '46 Spadina Road',
    name: 'Larry Ducksworth',
    city: 'Toronto',
    province: 'ON'
  }
}
```

If we wanted to access the items in this object we could write:

```javascript
order.items
```

If we wanted to get the **second** item, we could write:

```javascript
order.items[1]
```

We can also access object values using square brackets notation:

```javascript
order['items'][0]
```

It may be helpful to play around with accessing different elements in your sample response object before you start adding the information to your page.

Remember that the `debugger` keyword can be used to create a breakpoint, and allow you to stop code as it's running, and investigate what's happening at that moment in the program's execution.
