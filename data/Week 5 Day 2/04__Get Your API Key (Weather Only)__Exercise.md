In order to use some API's, you need to get an API key. This API key is associated with an account, and tells the server you're sending requests to "Hey, I'm allowed to send you requests".

To use the Weather API we've picked out, you'll have to sign up for an account and find your API key in your dashboard.

Then, declare a variable at the top of your `index.js` file, and set it to the value of your API key.
Later, you'll add it to the url everytime you go to send a request to that API.
