### Wireframes

To start any web development project, the first step is to break it down into small,
manageable chunks. Today, we're going to build the basic outline of our HTML
page, it might not look beautiful at the end of today's class, but that's okay.

Most developers and designers start a project with a wire frame. It's a simple version
of the final project, and lets you show others your ideas before finalizing details
like fonts and colors.

To get started, we're going to focus on the `<header>` of our mockup.

Remember that HTML elements are like drawing a square on your web browser. Let's take a look
and outline the elements we'll need from our header.


![Marked up mock up](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/0X201f1m0L1i0W152s0Y/%5B9f987905b86fad5992688d87a7f55df4%5D_Image+2017-08-26+at+1.23.31+PM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=2818368&v=9ea7d889)


If we break down the header section of our mockup, we see this `<header>` contains
3 main pieces
- A nav bar
- A section for your name, and occupation
- A photo

Each one of these 3 main pieces will be it's own HTML element:

- [ ] In your `index.html` file add a `<header>` tag
- [ ] Add a nav bar to your header
- [ ] Inside of your nav, add an `ul` with list items about, skills, experience, and contact
- [ ] Add an element to contain your name, and occupation
- [ ] Add an `img` tag with a picture
  - Tip: If you don't have one ready, try one of these sites for a placeholder
    - [place kitten](https://placekitten.com/)
    - [place cage](http://www.placecage.com/)
    - [Fill Murray](https://www.fillmurray.com/)

Note that we will be using CSS later to adjust our layout and the style of these elements. Don't worry
if your page looks far from the finished project.

In the live preview from Brackets, your page should look something like this:
