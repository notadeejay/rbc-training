<!-- Too much going on in this file - break it out into different pieces -->
### Starting with Code

Starting any project can seem overwhelming. The trick is to break it down into small, manageable chunks.
Today, we're going to build the basic outline of our HTML
page, it might not look beautiful at the end of today's class, but that's okay.

We're going to start by planning out how we're going to build the `<header>` of our profile page. Let's take a look at our mockup
and outline the elements we'll need to add.

If we break down the header section of our mockup, we see this `<header>` contains
3 main pieces
- A nav bar
- A section for your name, and occupation
- A photo

<!-- Add explanation for an image / self closing tag -->

Each one of these 3 main pieces will be it's own HTML element:

- [ ] In your `index.html` file add a `<header>` tag
- [ ] Add a nav bar to your header (the `nav` tag is a great choice for this)
- [ ] Inside of your nav, add an `ul` with list items about, skills, experience, and contact
- [ ] Add an element to contain your name, and occupation
- [ ] Add an `img` tag with a picture
  - Tip: If you don't have one ready, try one of these sites for a placeholder
    - [place kitten](https://placekitten.com/)
    - [place cage](http://www.placecage.com/)
    - [Fill Murray](https://www.fillmurray.com/)

Note that we will be using CSS later to adjust our layout and the style of these elements. Don't worry
if your page looks far from the finished project.

In the live preview from Brackets, your page should look something like this:
