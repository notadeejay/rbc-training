## Add Skills Section

In our skills section, we're going to create an HTML **list**. There are two main
types of lists, **ordered lists** and **unordered lists**. Ordered lists automatically
add numbers to each list item, while unordered lists have bullet points by default.

An **unordered list tag** looks like this:

```html
<ul><ul>
```

If I were to make a list of things you'd find around Lighthouse, it might look like:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Sherman</li>
  <li>Rubber Ducks</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
```

Add a new `<section>` tag for your skills section, then:
- [ ] Add an `<h1>` element with the text **Skills**
- [ ] Add an `<ul>` tag, and list some of your skills in list item (`<li>`) tags


Once you have completed that, the preview of your page should look something like:
