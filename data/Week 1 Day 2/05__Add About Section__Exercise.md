There are several HTML tags we can use to describe the layout of our page.

`<section>` is one of them.

To your `index.html`, below your closing `header` tag, add a `<section>` tag


We can use the same exercise to break down our **About** section.

Inside of your new section tag add:
- [ ] An `<h1>` That contains 'About'
- [ ] An `<h5>` With a tag line
- [ ] Two `<p>` tags with some awesome information about you



If you're unsure what to write about yourself, a common technique is to use *lorem ipsum* text.

Choose a theme, and have it generate some paragraphs for you. Then, add some `<p>` tags and add it to your about section.
