During this course we'll be using a **code editor** called Atom.

Just like Microsoft Word or Google Docs will underline grammatical errors, a code editor will highlight errors in your code.

## Tasks

- Download and install Atom on your computer: <https://atom.io/>
- Open Atom
- Create a new folder for your project
- Create an `index.html` file in your new project folder
- Add some text to your `index.html` file
- Click the file name in the bottom left corner
- Copy your link into your browser, and view your HTML page

## Tips & tricks

Once you've downloaded, installed, and opened the app, you should see something like this:

Atom lets you write code and then immediately preview it in your browser. To see a preview of your page, simply click the link in the bottom left hand corner, and paste that link into your browser.

As you can see in the short video, when your file has unsaved changes, you will notice a dot in the tab, when it's saved, the dot disappears. This is a great way to check quickly if you've saved your file.
