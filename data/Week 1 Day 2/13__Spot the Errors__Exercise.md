<!-- Add poorly written HTML and get them to fix / spot the errors  -->
<!-- Can be done as a group or as individuals -->
Look through the following poorly-written HTML (of a simple blog web page) for any errors or mistakes. You may choose to make notes of all the errors/mistakes and how you would fix them, or to copy and paste this HTML into CodePen (https://codepen.io/pen/) and fix it directly. Once you've found and fixed all the mistakes/errors, compare your solution with a classmate to verify you've found all the mistakes/errors.
