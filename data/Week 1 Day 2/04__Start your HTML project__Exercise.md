## Goal

Today we're going to set up your project that you will be working on for the next several classes.


Your first project will be building a website all about YOU. We've come up with a great
design for you, but don't be afraid to customize it using your favourite colours and fonts.

[Check out the design here](https://cl.ly/2u3D2E2f1m08)

Over the next few classes, we'll slowly add to your project, before we deploy it in Week 3!



### Exercises
###### Create your project folder, and open it in brackets

- [ ] Create an empty **folder** on your computer, and give it a name like `personal_site_project`
- [ ] Open your empty folder in Brackets
- [ ] Create file in your folder called `index.html`


### Add HTML skeleton code

We learned in today's lecture that every HTML document needs a few tags to get started.
