Today you're going to set up your project that you will be working on for the next several classes.


Your first project will be building a resume page. We've come up with a great design for you to build from, but don't be afraid to customize the project to reflect your personality! Or, if you don't want to build a resume for yourself, build one for your favourite fictional character!

Over the next few classes, we'll slowly add to your project and deploy it!

"Deploy" is a fancy way of saying we'll put your website on the internet, so the whole world can see your awesome projects.

**Note**: We're SO excited to checkout your websites and learn more about you, but keep in mind that since we're deploying these sites, only include information you're comfortable sharing publicly.

## Tasks

- Add this HTML skeleton code to your `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

## HTML skeleton code?

There are a few essential HTML tags that every HTML page needs to work properly.

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`
  - Tells your browser this is an HTML page.
2. `<html>`
  - Wraps around **all** of the HTML elements on your page.
3. `<head>`
  - The head is where we put any information that the browser might need to render your page properly (such as styling files, which we'll learn about next week). Most of the content here
  won't be seen by your user.
4. `<body>`
  - The body tag contains **all** of the HTML elements that you want to be displayed to visitors of your page. This is where you will be writing the majority of your HTML code.
