Over the next couple of weeks we will be slowly building this project, before deploying
it.


## Create your project folder, and open it in brackets

- [ ] Create an empty folder on your computer, and give it a name like `personal_site_project`
- [ ] Open your empty folder in Brackets
- [ ] Create file in your folder called `index.html`

### Add HTML skeleton code

We learned in today's lecture that every HTML document needs a few tags to get started.

Add this code to your `index.html` file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
