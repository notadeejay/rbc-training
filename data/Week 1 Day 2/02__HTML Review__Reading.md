### HTML Basics

Before we jump into our HTML project, let's do a quick re-cap of what we've learned today.

HTML gives your web page structure. *add more here*


HTML elements are composed of three key pieces:
1. The opening tag
2. Some content
3. A closing tag

![html example](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/0m3z3e1m0R3I3K0l3m3H/Image%202017-08-27%20at%202.33.57%20PM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=2818368&v=8fa49697)


In some cases, we need to give our HTML tags a little bit more information. We can do this using attributes. Attributes are always added to the opening HTML tag. On most tags, attributes are optional, but there are a few that need attributes to work properly, like anchor tags and image tags.

One type of attribute is a CSS class. It's often used for styling elements on your webpage.

Say we wanted this paragraph tag to have the class highlight:

We can also nest HTML elements together, like so:
