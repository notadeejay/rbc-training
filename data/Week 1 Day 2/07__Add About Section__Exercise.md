Let's take the same approach from the **Header** and break down the main pieces of our **About** section.

![about sections](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/3Q041Z0f0J1K3L2e1207/%5B11d28338047cc6565674104b4059d6f9%5D_Image+2017-08-26+at+2.02.24+PM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=2818368)


We can break it down into four main pieces:

- A container element that holds the entire section
- A section title
- A subtitle
- A few paragraphs

When you're done, the **About** section should look something like this:

## Tasks

- Add a container element for your About `<section>`
- Add a title to the section
- Add a subtitle
- Add a few paragraphs all about you


## HTML tags reference

These HTML elements might come in handy as you're building this section.

#### p

A common HTML element, used for, well, paragraphs.

```html
<p>
  <!-- Paragraph Text here -->
</p>
```

#### section

Semantic tag, used when grouping a collection of elements together when they have a title.

```html
<section>
    <h2>Kitten Pictures</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Whiskers</p>
      <img src="http://placekitten/img/200/300" alt="grey kitten">
    </div>
</section>
```

#### Headings

Heading tags (`h1` -> `h6`) are used to add titles, headings and subheadings to your web page.

```html
<h1>Webpage Title</h1>
```


#### article

Article tags are used to wrap pieces of content that can be read independently from the rest of the website. Common examples are blog posts, magazine articles, and news reports.

```html
<article>
  <h3>Article Title </h3>
  <p>Once up on a time ... </p>
</article>
```

#### div

A div is a generic container element. You can use it to group elements together, or for styling purposes (once we get to CSS).

```html
<div>
  <h4>Title</h4>
  <img src="./logo.png" src="Company Logo"/>
</div>
```

## Tips and Tricks

If you've suddenly found yourself with a serious case of writer's block, and simply cannot think of anything to write about yourself, try using **Lorem Ipsum** text. Lorem Ipsum is Latin text that is commonly used as a placeholder.

Visit [Meet the Ipsums](http://meettheipsums.com/), and pick a themed placeholder text, if you happen to be stuck.
