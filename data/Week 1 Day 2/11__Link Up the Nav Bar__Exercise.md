<!-- Good candidate for a stretch goal -->

Just like we can link to our instagram, and twitter accounts, we can add links so
a visitor to our website can navigate around our page. We can do this using `anchor` tags and `ids`.


We can add an anchor tag with an href like this:

```html
  <a href="#about">About</a>
```

And add an `id` to a `section` to our page:

```html
  <section id="about">
  </section>
```

Then, when we click our anchor tag, the page will automatically scroll to find an HTML element
with that id.

For each `li` item in your nav bar, link it to a section on your page. When you are finished, you should have a link for your

- [ ] Skills Section
- [ ] About Section
- [ ] Experience Section
- [ ] Contact Section


Once you've added these, when you click on a link in your nav bar, you should be taken to the appropriate section on your page:

Once your done adding the content to your webpage, swap with a class mate and review each others code. Make sure you check for proper indentation and properly closed tags :)
