## Objectives

By the end of this class, you should be able to:
- Translate a wirefame into a basic HTML document using a code editor 
- Use semantic tags and explain why they are preferable over a non-semantic tags
- Demonstrate consistent indentation and explain why this is important to developers

## Teacher Notes

Make sure you have downloaded and played around with Atom prior to this lecture.

Go very slowly and explain everything you're doing. Demonstrate that it will highlight
HTML as you go. Work incrementally, (write a bit of code save, and show them the result).

Constantly remind them that they will need to save, and refresh their page to see the results.

Don't forget to demonstrate that when the dot is in the corner of the file instead of an X the file is not saved.

## Things to Cover

- Write a simple HTML page that uses several basic HTML tags. Use an `img` to demonstrate self closing tags
- Use semantic tags, and demonstrate why they're preferable over `div`s (div soup, etc.)
- Using a simple mockup or design of a web page, walk students through how to convert a design into HTML document.
- Discuss the thought process behind choosing different tags, and that there is more than one way to achieve the same result.
- Show them how to create an HTML file in atom
- Show them what happens when you forget to close a quote on an attribute
- Demonstrate good indentation, and explain why this is important to developers (i.e. 'imagine reading a book where no proper punctuation is used')
- Remind them they must be _very_ specific, sometimes a missing quote or `<` will cause all sorts of problems,
reassure them that they will get better at spotting these errors the more practice they have.
- Show them common mistakes (missing quotes, two opening tags, etc.)

## Out of Scope

- CSS, leave it for the next day
