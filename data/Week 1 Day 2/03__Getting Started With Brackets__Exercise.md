## Where do I write code?

During this course we'll be using a **code editor** called [brackets](http://brackets.io/).

Just like Microsoft Word or Google Docs will underline grammatical errors, a code editor
will highlight errors in your code.

## Exercises

#### Download Brackets

If you haven't already, your first step is to download [brackets](http://brackets.io/). Follow the instructions
to install brackets on your computer.

- [ ] **Download Brackets**
- [ ] Open Brackets

Once you've downloaded the app, and opened it up, you should see something like this:

Brackets lets you write code and then immediately preview it in your browser. To see a preview
of what this getting started HTML page looks like in the browser, click the lightning bolt shaped
icon in the top right corner.

As you can see in the above video, the brackets preview shows you which part of the HTML you are editing.

- [ ] Read through the welcome text, and familiarize yourself with Brackets
- [ ] Edit the text in the `index.html` so it includes your name and a quirky fact
- [ ] Take a screen shot of your edits and share them in your class's slack group
