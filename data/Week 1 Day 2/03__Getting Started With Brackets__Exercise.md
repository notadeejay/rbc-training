During this course we'll be using a **code editor** called Brackets.

Just like Microsoft Word or Google Docs will underline grammatical errors, a code editor will highlight errors in your code.

## Tasks

- Download and install Brackets to your computer: <http://brackets.io/>
- Open Brackets
- Click the **Preview** button in the top right corner
- Edit the text in `index.html` so it includes your name and a quirky fact
- Take a screen shot of your edits and share them in your class's Slack group

## Tips & tricks

Once you've downloaded, installed, and opened the app, you should see something like this:

Brackets lets you write code and then immediately preview it in your browser. To see a preview of what this getting started HTML page looks like in the browser, click the lightning bolt shaped
icon in the top right corner.

<!-- Replace this with a Gif -->
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/231201198" width="640" height="337" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

As you can see in the above video, the Brackets preview shows you which part of the HTML you are editing.
