Let's repeat the same exercise we did with the **About** section and the **Skills** section.

If we drew a box around all of the components of our experience section, we might get something
like this:

We need an element to hold the section title, **Experience**. And some elements to contain all of the information we want to write about our past work experiences.

### Tasks

- [ ] Add a `<section>` tag, inside add:
  - [ ] Add an `<h2>` with the title 'Experience'
  - [ ] For each job, add a `div`, inside each add:
    - [ ] A `<div>` to contain:
      - [ ] Dates of employment (An `h4` might be a good choice for this one)
      - [ ] Job Title
    - [ ] A `<div>` to contain:
      - [ ] The company name
      - [ ] A `p` tag with a description of your job

When you have added the content for your experience section, your preview should look something like:
