## Goal

Today we'll be learning the basics of HTML, and how to use our code editor, Brackets.


## Teacher Notes

Make sure you have downloaded and played around with Brackets prior to this lecture.

Go very slowly and explain everything you're doing. Demonstrate that it will highlight
HTML as you go. Work incrementally, (write a bit of code save, and show them the result).

Don't forget to demonstrate that when the dot is in the corner of the file instead of an X the file is not saved.

#### Live coding:

> Write a simple HTML page that uses several basic HTML tags. Use an `img` to demonstrate self closing tags

#### Approach:

- Show them how to create an HTML file in brackets
- Show them what happens when you forget to close a quote on an attribute
- Demonstrate good indentation, and explain why this is important to developers (i.e. 'imagine reading a book where no proper punctuation is used')
- Remind them they must be _very_ specific, sometimes a missing quote or `<` will cause all sorts of problems,
reassure them that they will get better at spotting these errors the more practice they have.
