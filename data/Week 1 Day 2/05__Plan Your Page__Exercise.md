Before you jump into writing code, it's often best to come up with a plan of how you'll build your project. In high school, you may have written an outline for an essay before writing your first draft. You may have come up with a few bullet points for your introduction, your supporting paragraphs, and your conclusion. We'll do a similar thing here: we're going to break down the steps required in building your resume site. Only instead of defining the outline based on content (like you may have done with an essay), we're going to define it by the logical steps required by the technologies we'll use to build the page.

A resume page, or any other webpage with a similar purpose, first needs the content to be written in well-structured and semantic HTML. Once that's done, the page can be styled with CSS. Styling is a big job, however, and so we'll break that down into more concrete steps as well, to help us focus on different aspects of the styling one at a time. Finally, once the page is looking beautiful, we'll need to test and deploy it.

To sum that up, we're going to break the process of building the resume page into the following seven steps, which we'll be working on over the next five classes:

1. Add HTML structure (Today)
2. Add custom colours and fonts using CSS (Week 2 Day 1)
3. Fix the layout using Flexbox (Week 2 Day 2)
4. Polish up the styling (Week 3 Day 1)
5. Make the site responsive (Week 3 Day 2)
6. Test (Week 3 Day 2)
7. Deploy (Week 3 Day 2)

Don't worry if you don't know what all the steps mean right now, because you'll learn exactly what they refer to as we go along! Don't worry also if there are going to be days when your resume page doesn't look "pixel perfect" – that's totally fine, it will all come together by the end!


## Breaking down the design

Today we're going to get step 1 above done, that is, we're going to write the HTML for the resume page.

In order to do that, first we're going to break down the design we've been given into smaller chunks – essentially, the major components of the page that are going to define its structure.

Looking at our resume page design, we see that it can be broken down into five major components:

- Header
- About Section
- Skills Section
- Experience Section
- Footer

As we build the structure and add the content to each of these sections, we're going to further break each of these components down into smaller pieces. Let's get to it!
