Before you jump into writing code, it's often best to come up with a detailed plan of how to build your project.
Just like when you wrote an essay back in high school, it's easiest if you've got a roadmap or detailed outline ready.

We're going to break down the design we've been given into manageable pieces.

In order to build your personal site, we're going to break it down into three major steps:

1. Add necessary HTML structure
2. Add some custom colors and fonts using CSS
3. Fix the layout using Flexbox
4. Make it responsive!


Throughout the course, there might be days where your webpage doesn't look pixel perfect at the end.
Keep in mind that is perfectly fine.

If we take a step back and look at our HTML page design, we can break it down into five major components:

- Header
- About Section
- Skills Section
- Experience Section
- Footer

We're going to break each of these components down into smaller pieces, and slowly add them to our project.
We won't worry about font colors, or fixing the layout today, rather we'll focus on adding the structural pieces and our content
to our webpage.
