Before you jump into writing code, it's often best to have an outline or a plan of attack.

Just like when you wrote an essay back in high school, it's easiest if you've got a roadmap or detailed outline ready.

Developers and designers often start with a **wire frame**.
<!-- Add definition of wire frame -->


In order to build your personal site, we're going to break it down into three major steps:

1. Add necessary HTML structure
2. Add some custom colors and fonts using CSS
3. Fix the layout using Flexbox
4. Make it responsive!


Throughout the course, there might be days where your webpage doesn't look pixel perfect at the end.
Keep in mind that is perfectly fine.
