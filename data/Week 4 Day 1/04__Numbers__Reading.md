Computers compute, so as you probably expected, JavaScript can be used to add, subtract, divide, and multiply numbers.

```javascript
console.log(1 + 2)
// would log 3 to the console

console.log(10 - 2)
// would log 8 to the console

console.log(12 / 4)
// would log 3 to the console

console.log(3 * 4)
// would log 12 to the console
```

## Exercise

- If you haven't already, open up [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/javascript)
- Use `console.log` to print a number to the screen on the right
- Add two numbers and log the output
- Multiply two numbers and log the output
- Divide two numbers and log the output
