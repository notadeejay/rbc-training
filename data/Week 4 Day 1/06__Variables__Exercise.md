### Variables

A well kept secret of programmers is that we’re incredibly lazy. I mean, really, really, really lazy. We don’t like to write more code that we have to. Variables are one way that you can save a value and use it over and over again in your code.

To declare a variable in our code, we first need to use the keyword `var`. Then we give our variable a name, and then we assign it a value.

```javascript
var firstName = "Maggie"
```
In this example, we are assigning the variable firstName to the string “Maggie”.

Follow these steps when you want to declare a variable
1. Start with the var keyword
2. Give it a name (try to be descriptive!)
3. Use the = sign
4. Give it a value
Then, we can use variables like this:

```javascript
var message = "I’m learning JavaScript!"
console.log(message)
// would output “I’m learning JavaScript"
```
