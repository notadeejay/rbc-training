### Variables

A well kept secret of programmers is that we’re incredibly lazy. I mean, really, really, really lazy. We don’t like to write more code that we have to. Variables are one way that you can save a value and use it over and over again in your code. You can think of it like a bookmark. Imagine you were filling out a form that made you fill in your first name over, and over and over again. Wouldn’t it be great if you could write it once, and have(fix this analogy)

To declare a variable in our code, we first need to use the keyword var. Then we give our variable a name, and then we assign it a value.

```javascript
var firstName = "Maggie"
```
In this example, we are assigning the variable firstName to the string “Maggie”.

Follow these steps when you want to declare a variable
1. Start with the var keyword
2. Give it a name (try to be descriptive!)
3. Use the = sign
4. Give it a value
Then, we can use variables like this:

```javascript
var message = "I’m learning JavaScript!"
console.log(message)
// would output “I’m learning JavaScript"
```
