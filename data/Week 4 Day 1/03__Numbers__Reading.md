Computers compute, so as you probably expected, JavaScript can be used to add, subtract, divide, and multiply numbers.

```javascript
console.log(1 + 2)
// would log 3 to the console

console.log(10 - 2)
// would log 8 to the console

console.log(12 / 4)
// would log 3 to the console

console.log(3 * 4)
// would log 12 to the console
```
