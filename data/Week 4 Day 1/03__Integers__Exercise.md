## Integers
Integers are simply whole numbers. Just like you know how to add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers, JavaScript does too.

Note: When we write `console.log(“something”)` whatever is in between the brackets will be outputted to our console.

```javascript
console.log(1 + 2)
// would output 3

console.log(10 - 2)
// would output 8

console.log(12 / 4)
// would output 3

console.log(3 * 4)
// would output 12
```

Tasks:
- [ ] If you haven't already, open up [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/javascript)
- [ ] Use `console.log` to print an integer to the screen on the right
- [ ] Add two numbers together and log the output
- [ ] Multiply two numbers and log the output
