## Integers
Integers are simply whole numbers. Just like you know how to add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers, JavaScript does too.

Note: When we write console.log(“something”) whatever is in between the brackets will be outputted to our console.

```javascript
console.log(1 + 2)
// would output 3

console.log(10 - 2)
// would output 8

console.log(12 / 4)
// would output 3

console.log(3 * 4)
// would output 12
```

Tasks:
[ ] Create a JavaScript file and open it in your code editor
[ ] Use console.log to print an integer to the screen
[ ] Add two numbers together and log the output
