## Teacher Notes

## Goal

Introduce them to the concepts of Programming.
- Comments
- Integers
- Strings
- Booleans
- Variables
- If Statements
- Functions

### Tips

- Go slowly and make sure you mention common mistakes or syntax errors.
- Demonstrate what an error message looks like
- Ask Questions as you go to make sure they are on board with what you're saying.


### Format

The format of this lecture will be a break from tradition. Instead of lecturing for an hour and letting them try it on their own, we'll split the lecture into chunks and let them explore each concept right after we've introduced it.

The "mini" challenges will be present in both the lecture slides and the curriculum so students who miss one or two can come back and finish them at a later date.
