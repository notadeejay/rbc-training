## Teacher Notes
- Go slowly and make sure you mention common mistakes or syntax errors.
- Demonstrate what an error message looks like
- Ask Questions as you go to make sure they are on board with what you're saying.

The format of this lecture is a shift from the typical day - each concept we introduce has 'mini challenges' associated with it.
The best way to deliver this lecture is to introduce a concept - let them try it out, and once everyone is comfortable, move along to the next one.
