## Functions

Sometimes we have a piece of logic or code that we find ourselves using over and over again. To prevent having to rewrite this code in several different places, we can use a function.

Functions can also take parameters too. That is, when we call a function we give it a little piece of information:

### Tasks:
- [ ] Write a function that outputs “Good morning” when you call it
- [ ] Write a function that takes one parameter and says good morning followed by a `firstName` passed to the function
- [ ] Write a function that recommends you take an umbrella, if the parameter passed is the string ‘raining’.


### More about functions

In JavaScript we can save any datatype to a variable. Instead of logging values to our console, our JavaScript functions
can also **return** a value. We do this by using the `return` keyword in our code.


### Built In Functions

In addition to letting you write your own functions, JavaScript comes with some functions ready to use, right out of the box.
Each datatype has its own set of built in functions.
