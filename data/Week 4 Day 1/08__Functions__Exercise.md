## Functions

Sometimes we have a piece of logic or code that we find ourselves using over and over again. To prevent having to rewrite this code in several different places, we can use a function.


Functions can also take parameters too. That is, when we call a function we give it a little piece of information:


### Tasks:
[ ] Write a function that outputs “Good morning” when you call it
[ ] Write a function that takes one parameter and says good morning followed by a firstName passed to the function
[ ] Write a function that recommends you take an umbrella, if the parameter passed is the string ‘raining’.
