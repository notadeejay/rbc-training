## Functions

Sometimes we have a piece of logic or code that we find ourselves using over and over again. To prevent having to rewrite this code in several different places, we can use a function.

![function example](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/0O2u2j3Q06081E0z3p3z/Image%202017-08-29%20at%208.16.47%20PM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=2818368&v=dc2a1974)


Functions can also take parameters too. That is, when we call a function we give it a little piece of information:


### Tasks:
[ ] Write a function that outputs “Good morning” when you call it
[ ] Write a function that takes one parameter and says good morning followed by a firstName passed to the function
[ ] Write a function that recommends you take an umbrella, if the parameter passed is the string ‘raining’.
