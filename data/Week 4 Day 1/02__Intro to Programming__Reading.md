#### What is programming?
When you break it down, all code is, is instructions for computers. When you learn to code, you’re learning how to communicate with your computer. Earlier in the course you created an applet on IFFTT. Code often follows the same logic, if this happens, then do this.

When we communicate with each other, we rely on a lot of context. If someone sent you a text that said:

`Can you make me a cup of tee?`

Even though they made a spelling errors, you, as a human, could figure out that what they were trying to say. When we communicate instructions to computers, we have to be very specific. We need to break down problems into steps so simple even a computer can understand them.

When you are asked to make a cup of tea, you don’t need instructions on how to do it, you likely know you need to get a mug, boil some water and add a tea bag. If you were instructing a computer, you would have to ‘explain’ what a mug is, how to open a package of tea, what temperature the water needs to be heated at, and explicitly define the order in which the steps need to take place.

When you’re learning to code, and even when you’ve been writing code for a while, it’s common to make mistakes. Don’t get discouraged.

## Data Types

Take a second and think about all of the information you put into your computer or your phone each day. Let’s pretend you are buying concert tickets online.
[ ] Make a quick list of all the information you need to input in order to buy tickets to see your favourite artist.


When you’re done - you’ve probably got a list that looks something like this:
* first name
* last name
* email address
* credit card number
* expiry date
* price
* quantity
* location
* pick up / print tickets
* date

All of the information we input into our apps and programs needs to be represented in our code. To make this process easier, all coding languages have data types. Just like we have numbers and words, code does to.

Today we're going to review all of these data types, and practice using them in our code.


## Functions

Sometimes we have a piece of logic or code that we find ourselves using over and over again. To prevent having to rewrite this code in several different places, we can use a function.


Functions can also take parameters too. That is, when we call a function we give it a little piece of information:


### Tasks:
[ ] Write a function that outputs “Good morning” when you call it
[ ] Write a function that takes one parameter and says good morning followed by a firstName passed to the function
[ ] Write a function that recommends you take an umbrella, if the parameter passed is the string ‘raining’.
