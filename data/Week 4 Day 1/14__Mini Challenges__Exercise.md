## Numbers

- If you haven't already, open up [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/javascript)
- Use `console.log` to print a number to the screen on the right
- Add two numbers and log the output
- Multiply two numbers and log the output
- Divide two numbers and log the output

## Strings

- Create a string containing your first name
- Log your string to the panel on the right
- Add some words together to make a sentence that greets your instructor
- What happens when you add a string and an integer together?

## Booleans

**Note:** For each of these tasks, use `console.log` to print the result of your comparison operations.

- Create two strings and check if they are equal
  - Are they still equal if one is capitalized?
- Check if two integers are equal
  - Are they still equal if one is a string?
- Create two strings and check if they are **not** equal to each other


## Variables

- Save your name to a variable called `firstName`
- Add your `firstName` variable to the string "Hello, " and log the result to the console
- Compare two integers, and save the resulting boolean to a variable
- What happens when you assign to the same variable twice? Use `console.log` to verify the value of your variable after each assignment


## If statements

Part I:

- Declare a variable called `age` and assign it to an integer
- Write an `if statement` that will output "Over 21!" if `age` is greater than or equal to 21, and "Under 21" if the it's under 21.

Part II:

- Declare a variable called `weather`, and assign it to a string
- Write some code to check if the `weather` variable is equal to "raining", and output a reminder to bring an umbrella
- Add an `else if` statement that checks if the weather is equal to "sunny", and output a reminder to bring a hat
- Add an `else` statement that just says "I'm not sure what you should bring!"

## Functions

- Write a function that outputs "Good morning" when you call it
- Write a function that takes a person's name as a parameter and says good morning to this person
- Write a function that takes the weather information as a parameter (that is, "raining", "sunny" or nothing), and outputs whether you should take an umbrella or hat along, or whether the computer doesn't know what you should bring along with you
- Write a function that divides two numbers and returns the result
- Write a function that takes two numbers and returns the largest one
- Write a function that checks if two strings are the same, and returns true or false

## Objects

- Create an object that keeps track of your personal information. Include your first name, last name, occupation and quirky fact
- Practice using both methods of accessing values in your object
- Change a value in your object after you've declared it
- Add a value for your home town to your object, after you've declared it

## Arrays

- Make a list of your top five favourite foods, and put them into an array
- Log each of your five favourite foods by their index values
- Add another food to your favourite foods array using the `.push` function

## Loops

- Create an array of your favourite movies (or books, or anything else you like)
- Loop over each movie and print its title to the console
- Add some code to your loop that will print the movie title in all caps
- Write a loop that will count from 20 down to 1
