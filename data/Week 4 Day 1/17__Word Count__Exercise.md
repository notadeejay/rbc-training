For the word count programming challenge, your job is to write a function that takes as parameters an array of words and another word, and returns how many times this word appears in the array.

For example, we may want to know how many times the word "pizza" appears in the following array:

```javascript
var foods = ["pizza", "celery", "bananas", "pizza", "lettuce", "cookies", "pizza"]
```

Here is some code to get you started:
```javascript

function wordCount(searchWord, wordsArray){
  // Add your code here
}
```

Using our foods answer as an example, we would expect the answer to be "3".

Once again, pair up with a partner and work through this problem together.
