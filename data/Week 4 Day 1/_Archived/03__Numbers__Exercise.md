Computers compute, so as you probably expected, JavaScript can be used to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.

```javascript
console.log(1 + 2)
// would output 3

console.log(10 - 2)
// would output 8

console.log(12 / 4)
// would output 3

console.log(3 * 4)
// would output 12
```

## Tips and Tricks

### console.log

In JavaScript, when we write `console.log()` whatever value we place between the two parentheses will be printed to the console.

```javascript
  console.log("Hello World!")
```
