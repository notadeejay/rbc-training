For the word count programming challenge, your job is to count how many times a word appears in an array.

For example, if this is our array:

```javascript
  var foods = ["pizza", "celery", "bananas", "pizza", "lettuce", "cookies", "pizza"]
```

And we want to know **how many times does pizza** appear in the array.

```javascript
  function countWord(array, word) {
    // add code
  }
```

Once again, pair up with a partner and work through this problem together.

<!--  
  Stretch goal will be to turn this into a 'word cloud', using an object to count how many times each word appears in the code
-->
