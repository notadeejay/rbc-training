Strings are any collection of characters wrapped in quotes. They can be one word

```javascript
'Hello'
```

or a whole sentence

```javascript
"Welcome to Lighthouse Labs"
```
and be written with single quotes or double quotes.

Like numbers, we can manipulate strings using code. For example, we can add strings together:

```javascript
"Good " + "morning, " + "Maggie"
// outputs "Good morning, Maggie"
```

If you look carefully, next to the comma in this example is a space. This is an example of needing to be very specific when we write code, without it, there would be no space between the words, and our output would be squished together.

One thing to note, is that this:

```javascript
'3'
```
is a string. Not an integer.
