## Teacher Notes

- Start with a review of JavaScript and the jQuery basics you learned last week
- Today in their projects they'll be using some example JSON to start to add results to their page,
on Wednesday we'll add in the actual AJAX requests.
- Good idea to review objects and how to parse them
