## Fizz Buzz

Fizz Buzz is a famous programming problem. To solve it, write some code that prints the numbers
from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print 'Fizz', for multiples of 5 print 'buzz', and for multiples
of both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz'.

To tackle this problem, grab a class mate and 'pair' through it. You can both write the code, but work through
the logic of the problem together.

**Tip**: When you're faced with a problem like this one, there are several good strategies to take:

1. Work out how YOU would solve the problem without any code
2. Break the problem down into smaller pieces (i.e. start with just printing the numbers 1 to 100 to the screen)
3. Work slowly and incrementally
