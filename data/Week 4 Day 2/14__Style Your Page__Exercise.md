So far, our page is fairly basic. We have a form and a results div that is shown and hidden. Take a moment to start filling out the rest of the page. It's helpful to make a quick sketch of what you would like your page to look like before you start writing code. Think back to the project planning you did for your HTML and CSS project, the same process will be helpful here.

## Tasks

- Add a Header with the title of your page
- Add a Footer
- Add a custom font (https://fonts.google.com/)
- Start adding a colour scheme to your project (https://coolors.co/)
- Adjust the layout using your Flexbox skills

Consider what type of results you will be displaying. Take a look at our example app for some ideas <http://jquery-weather.surge.sh/>
