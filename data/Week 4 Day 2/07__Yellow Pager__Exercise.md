## Yellow Pager

Another fun programming challenge is Yellow Pager.

Write a function that accepts a 10-character string of letters and outputs a corresponding phone number string.
If the input letter string isn't 10 characters, you should return false.

You can use this letter mapping to help you solve the problem:

```
2 -> A B C
3 -> D E F
4 -> G H I
5 -> J K L
6 -> M N O
7 -> P Q R S
8 -> T U V
9 -> W X Y Z
```

When solving a problem like this, it's often best to start with an example:

The string `Lighthouse` would output `5444846873`

Use the same strategies you did for FizzBuzz, write a solution for this problem. Keep
in mind that there are several ways to solve this problem, so if a classmate takes a different
approach as you, that's okay.

If you feel really stuck, grab a class mate and work through the project together. This is known
as pair programming and is quite common to find two developers working on one tricky problem.
