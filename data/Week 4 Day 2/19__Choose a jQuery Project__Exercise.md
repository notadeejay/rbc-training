Okay, it's time to put all of those JavaScript skills to use – over the next couple of weeks you will be building your own web app! We'll be giving you some tasks and guidelines, but you are free to be as creative as you want with your app's design and functionality.

You have three choices for your jQuery project.

## Weather app

A weather app that allows you to search the weather by city, and get a daily or five day forecast.

See a sample version of the app here: <http://jQuery-weather.surge.sh>

## Horoscopes app

This app will allow you to choose your star sign and get your daily horoscope.

See a sample version of the app here: <http://astrology.surge.sh/>

## Drink recipes app

An app that lets users search by drink name or ingredients for recipes and instructions.

See a sample version of the app here: <http://drink-recipe-finder.surge.sh/>

## Starter code

Each project comes with some starter code. In each starter code folder you'll find three files:

- `index.html` - This is where you will be writing all of your HTML code for your project.
- `styles.css` - This is where you will be writing all of your CSS code for your project.
- `app.js` - This is where you will be writing all of your JavaScript and jQuery code for your project.

## Downloading the starter code

To download your starter code go to:

<https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/front-end-fundamentals-js-starter-files>

Then, click the **Clone or download** button, and then click **Download ZIP**. Then, unzip your files, and open them in a text editor. If you're unsure of how to unzip a file on your computer, ask a mentor for help.
