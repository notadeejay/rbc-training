This stretch exercise will build off of your solution to the previous [Word Count](/a6770ebe-6f79-435c-b1e0-34a9c7289661) exercise. Write a function that takes in an array of words, and returns an object that specifies how many times a word appears in this array.

For example, if you passed the following array to the function:

```javascript
['hello', 'pizza', 'phone', 'desk', 'hello', 'table', 'desk']
```

The function should then return the following object:

```javascript
{
  'hello': 2,
  'pizza': 1,
  'phone': 1,
  'desk': 2,
  'table': 1
}
```
