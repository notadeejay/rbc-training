Another fun programming challenge is the Yellow Pager.

Write a function that accepts a 10-character string of letters and returns a corresponding phone number string. If the input letter string is not exactly 10 characters, return false instead.

Use the following number to letter mapping to turn a string into a phone number:

```
2 -> A B C
3 -> D E F
4 -> G H I
5 -> J K L
6 -> M N O
7 -> P Q R S
8 -> T U V
9 -> W X Y Z
```

When solving a problem like this, it's often a good idea to start with some examples, so you know what the correct output should be:

The string `Lighthouse` should output `5444846873`.

The string `Helloworld` should output `4355696753`.

Keep in mind that there are several ways to solve this problem, so if a classmate takes a different approach than you, that's okay.

Pair with another classmate and work through the logic together!
