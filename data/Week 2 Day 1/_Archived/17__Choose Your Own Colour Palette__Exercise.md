You're welcome to use the styles we chose for your in the design, but feel free to chose your own colours, fonts, and styles as you go along. It's *your* project, after all.

[Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) is an app that generates colour palettes that you can save and use in a project. Check it out, and if you find a colour palette you like more than the one we've provided, add it to your project!

As you can see, it provides you with the hexadecimal colours, making it quite easy to add these to your page.
