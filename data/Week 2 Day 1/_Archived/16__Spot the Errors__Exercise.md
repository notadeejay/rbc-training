Look through the following poorly-written CSS for any errors or mistakes (they may be technical or stylistic, keep an eye out for both). Once you've found them all, grab a classmate and compare what you've found!

```css
  p (
    colour: blue;
    )
  .highlight {
  background-color: orange
    fontsize = 120px;
  }

  p article div {font-weight:900}

  main {
    font-style: normal;




  }

  .test {
    font-color=green;
  }

```
