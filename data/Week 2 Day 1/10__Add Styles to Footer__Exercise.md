Let's move on to adding styles to the **footer** of our web page.

### Tasks

- [ ] Add CSS to style the footer and change the color of the background
- [ ] Add Styles to make sure the text is still legible
- [ ] Style the anchor tags in the footer to have a font size of `12px`

**Tip:** Remember you can use more than one tag or selector.

For example, if you *only* wanted the `p` tags in a `section`, you could style them like so:

```css
  section p {
    color: blue;
  }
```
