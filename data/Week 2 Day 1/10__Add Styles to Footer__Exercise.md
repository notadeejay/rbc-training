### Tasks

- [ ] Add CSS to style the footer and change the color of the background
- [ ] Add CSS styles to change the font color, if needed
- [ ] Change the font in the footer to be an appropriate size

**Tip:** Remember you can use more than one tag or selector.

### Tips and Tricks

For example, if you *only* wanted the `p` tags in a `section`, you could style them like so:

```css
  section p {
    color: blue;
  }
```
