## Tasks

- Style the **Footer** such that its background colour matches your design
- Change the `font-color` of the text in the **Footer** so it can be easily read against your new background colour


## Tips & Tricks

**Remember you can use more than one tag per selector.**

For example, if you only want to style `<p>` tags that appear *within* a `<section>`, you could do that like this:

```css
section p {
  color: blue;
}
```
