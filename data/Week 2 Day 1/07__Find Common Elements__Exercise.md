In today's exercises, we're going to start adding some styles to our webpage. We'll focus today on learning how to use tags, classes and IDs to select elements on our page. Most of the styles we apply today are going to involve fonts and colours. We will be adjusting the layout in our next class, so don't worry if your page doesn't match the design by the end of the night.

We've learned that classes can be used to allow elements to share styles. Each element on our page can have as many classes as it needs, and we can reuse our classes on as many elements as we'd like.

When you notice that several elements on your page have similar styles, it's often a good indication that you can use a class.
Before we jump in to writing CSS we'll look through our design for elements that share styles.


## Colours
The **Header** and the **Skills** section both have a blue background and white text.

## Fonts
All of our sections have a section title. They are all the same font weight and font size.

All of our subtitles share the same font size and weight too.
