## Keep coding!

Just like with everything else, practice is the key. Keep working on your jQuery, HTML and CSS skills. If you're looking for project ideas, build a website for your friends, neighbours, or your business. As well, you can go back and build the jQuery projects you didn't choose to do in this course. You will always have access to Compass, so you can come back to re-read any assignments as you continue to work on your projects.

Attending coffee and code meetups, or hack nights can be a great way to level-up your skills while making new coder friends!
