### Keep Coding

Just like everything else, practice is key. Keep working on your jQuery, HTML and CSS skills. If you're looking for project ideas, build a website for your friends, neighbours, or your business. As well, you can go back and build the jQuery projects you didn't choose to do in this course. You will always have access to compass, and can come back and re-read any assignments as you continue to work on your projects.

Attending coffee and code meetups, or hack nights can be a great way to up your skills while making more friends.
