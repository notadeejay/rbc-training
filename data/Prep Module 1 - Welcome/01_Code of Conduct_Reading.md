## Code of Conduct 

Lighthouse Labs is a private education and training institution intended for enriching the developer community and building the next generation of developers. We value the participation of each member of each cohort and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the cohort and at all events, on or off campus, whether associated with Lighthouse Labs or not.

To make clear what is expected, all students, teachers, mentors, speakers, staff, organizers, and volunteers at any Lighthouse Labs event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. All of the above-mentioned ‘participants’ will be held equally accountable for their behaviour, with violation resulting in swift action being taken. 

Lighthouse Labs is dedicated to providing a harassment-free education experience. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Harassment includes but is not limited to: any and all verbal, written or digital communication that has potential to be perceived as offensive in relation to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion; sexual images (personal or public) being viewable on your computer by others;  deliberate intimidation be it physical or verbal; stalking or following; unwelcomed photography or recordings; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate and/or unwanted physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience. Sexual or derogatory language and/or imagery is not appropriate. This includes during lecture, general mentorship time, while working in smaller groups and one on one with mentors and on both Lighthouse Labs or personal digital communications channels including Slack. Excessive swearing is not appropriate at Lighthouse Labs.

This Code is inclusive of activities and communications that happen on and off campus, whether the activity is an official Lighthouse Labs event or not. 

Guest speakers, meetups, or similar activities which are supported by Lighthouse Labs are also subject to this policy. In particular, guest speakers should not use sexualized or derogatory images, activities, or other material.

Be careful with the words you choose and comments you make. Be kind to one another. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Be mindful when referring to others using nicknames or ‘pet names.’ Remember that we are all here to learn and have a positive experience. 


If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, Lighthouse Labs may take any action they deem appropriate, including a warning at which time participants are expected to comply immediately. Violating these rules may also lead to expulsion from the cohort or venue, termination of contractor or employment, with no refund or recompense at the sole discretion of Lighthouse Labs. 

We strive to lead by example and believe we are all responsible for protecting our culture. If any participant sees or experiences behaviour that makes them uncomfortable or violates this policy, they are encouraged to inform staff so we can quickly take the appropriate action to ensure minimal disruption to the education experience of all our students. 

## Escalation Policy

Any concerning behaviour should be brought to the attention of a trusted staff member so that our General Managers can be made aware and appropriate action may be taken. The person bringing forward the concern may or may not have been directly affected by the behaviour and contact can be made via in person or digital means (email, slack, text etc.).

Our priority is to ensure the individual bringing the concern forward is heard, supported (by us and outside services if necessary), accommodated and is given full transparency of the escalation process as it unfolds and a resolution is determined. When possible the individual will be consulted on what steps they would like to take. We understand the sensitive and emotional nature of these complaints and highly value discretion and the privacy of all those involved.   If the individual wishes to remain anonymous, the staff will honour their request when bringing the complaint forward to the GM. However in some situations it may necessary for our GM and/or HR to speak to the individual in order to complete the investigation process. The individual is not required to speak directly with the individual in which the concern is made.   

It can be expected that any inquiries or investigations will take place within five school days of the initial concern being received. The GM of each branch will be responsible for taking lead on all actions following a concern being brought forward and will involve those who are deemed necessary to the process. After collecting all the information and undertaking appropriate consultation, the GM is responsible for communicating and enforcing the decision on behalf of Lighthouse Labs. 

Any form or perceived retaliation from individuals following the resolution of a complaint, regardless of the outcome, will not be tolerated. 

We are all coming from different backgrounds and experiences and it is what it makes us great and unique. We believe the vast majority of our participants share in a common sense approach and coming from a place of treating each other with respect. Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly educational experience for all.
