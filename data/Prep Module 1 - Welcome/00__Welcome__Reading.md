## Goal

This short reading gives you some important information about how to interact with Compass and our curriculum.

## About Compass

Compass is our custom-built Learning Management System developed by Lighthouse Labs graduates, staff and teachers. It is in active development and therefore always a work in progress. We're quite proud of it but we are always open to feedback!

## Your GitHub Profile

To access this page you registered for a GitHub account. If you haven't already, please update your [GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) with your full name, picture and other information you'd like to share. This profile will become quite important in the near future and it is important to start off with accurate information.

In order to log into Compass next time, you will again need to authorize your account through GitHub.

## Track your Progress

As you make your way through the various activities in Compass, you are expected to mark them as completed using the `Mark Completed` button at the top of the activity page (where available).

When marking an activity as complete you'll need to enter the time you spent on it, which will help us provide future students with better time estimates. The completion form will also ask you for some optional feedback.

## Curriculum Feedback

We treat our curriculum like a software product, which makes you the end user. We believe in rapid iteration based on feedback and performance, and to that end we greatly appreciate your feedback!

At the bottom of every activity you'll find a feedback form where you can write your comments, and optionally rate the activity and/or mark the feedback as largely positive, negative or neutral.

Don't worry about getting all your thoughts down at once â€“ you can submit feedback as many times as you like!
