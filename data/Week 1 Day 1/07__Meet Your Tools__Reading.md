In order to build your projects in this course, you'll need some tools. Here's a quick list of the tools we'll be using to build our projects, find our assignments, and communicate with each other throughout the course.

## Brackets

Your code editor is where you'll be writing all of your awesome code. Just like Word and Google Docs have features like a spell checker to help you be a better writer. Your code editor will help you write better code, for example by highlighting syntax errors and letting you easily preview your projects.

In this course we're going to be using Brackets. More on this next class!

## Chrome Developer Tools

Most browsers offer us tools to help us build web pages. In this course, we'll be using Chrome's Developer Tools. That also means we'll be using Google Chrome in this course â€“ a popular browser you may already be familiar with.

## Compass

Compass is the home of Lighthouse Labs' curriculum. You'll login each class to get access to the day's readings, exercises, and other resources.

## Slack

Slack is where you'll chat with classmates and instructors, and eventually, where you'll share links to your finished projects!
