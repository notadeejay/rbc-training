        answer: |
          ```bash
          ReferenceError: friend is not defined
          ```
        explanation: "The declaration of `friend` will be hoisted to the top, before the first `console.log` â€“ `friend` will therefore already be defined."
      -
        answer: |
          ```bash
          undefined
          E.T.
          ```
        explanation: "`friend` is hoisted to the top but given no value, therefore the first `console.log` will say `undefined`. Then, the value `\"E.T.\"` is set to `friend` before the second `console.log` which will output `\"E.T.\"`. "
        correct: true
      -
        answer: |
          ```bash
          friend
          E.T.
          ```
        explanation: "`friend` is a variable, and `console.log(friend)` will output the variable's value not the variable's name. When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its value will be `undefined`."
