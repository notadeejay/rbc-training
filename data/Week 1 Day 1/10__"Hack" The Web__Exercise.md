When we load a webpage into our browser, we can use our development tools to inspect the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. We can even use our development tools to edit the HTML, CSS and the content of that webpage. This is incredibly helpful when we are building websites and web apps. However, all of the changes we make to our webpages using our development tools will be lost when we refresh the page.

Today we're going to inspect some of our favourite websites, and change some content.

## Tasks

- Navigate to your favourite website in Google Chrome. If you don't have one, try Twitter or the New York Times' website
- Open up the Chrome Development Tools
- Use the Chrome Development Tools to change a tweet or a headline to be about you

## Tips & Tricks

Here's an example of how to change the content of a website you might be familiar with.
