Here are some terms you might hear at Lighthouse Labs:

## Bugs

Not *those* bugs. *Software* bugs. Have you ever used a website when something strange happened? Like suddenly it told you you had registered for your account in 1970, or when you clicked a button three times and then none of the links worked? Well then, you've found bugs. A bug happens when code has an error or an unintended consequence.

## Refactor

Refactoring code simply means editing it, often to make it easier to read, or to update it based on new requirements. As we get going you'll find that writing code is a lot like writing in general. There's more than one way to do "say" the same thing, and everyone will have their own style. Just like you might edit an essay or a report before you submit it, we can edit and tweak code too.

## Rubber Duck

Looking around Lighthouse Labs, you might start to wonder why so many adults have rubber ducks or other inanimate objects on their desk. Well, have you ever been _really_ stuck on a problem, but as soon as you started explaining it to someone else, you suddenly figured it out?

That's what rubber ducks are for. Instead of explaining a problem to another person, you explain it to your rubber duck, or your plant, or whatever. It's not as crazy as it sounds, we swear.
