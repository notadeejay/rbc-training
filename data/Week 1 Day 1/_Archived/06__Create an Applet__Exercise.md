Meet IFTTT.

IFTTT stands for "IF THIS THEN THAT". It's a web app for creating applets that allow you to connect a wide collection of web applications to each other.

For example, you can create an applet that will send you an email if it's going to rain tomorrow. Or one that will send you an email if an ad for a two bedroom apartment in your favourite neighbourhood is posted to Kijiji.

In this activity, you'll sign up for an account and create your own applet!
