Our first project is a **Resume Page**. Over the next couple of weeks, we'll be building a page that lets you share some information about yourself with the world. Before we jump into writing code, though, it's always best to plan our projects out.

We've come up with a great design for you to work from. You can check it out here: <https://cl.ly/2u3D2E2f1m08>

If you don't want to build a page for yourself, consider building a page for your favourite fictional character. After all, it is *your* project.

## Tasks

- Write a paragraph or two introducing yourself
- Come up with a list of skills you would like to include on your page
- Create a list of past job experiences, listing the dates, company name, job title, and a brief description for each one
- Create a list of links to your social media profiles

**Note:** Be sure to save this content somewhere, as we'll be using it over the next few classes!
