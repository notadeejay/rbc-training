## Lighthouse Labs Code of Conduct

Lighthouse Labs is a private education and training institution intended for enriching the developer community and building the next generation of developers. We value the participation of each member of each cohort and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the cohort and at all events, on or off campus, whether associated with Lighthouse Labs or not.

To make clear what is expected, all students, teachers, mentors, speakers, staff, organizers, and volunteers at any Lighthouse Labs event are required to conform to a [Code of Conduct](/fb16e0ce-487b-4d81-8591-8cea59750909). Please take a view minutes to review before heading home for the day!
