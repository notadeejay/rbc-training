Day 1 Lecture

## Teacher Notes

- The point of this lecture is to make sure students feel comfortable and excited about learning code. Remember this might be a step WAY out of a student's comfort zone. Keep explanations straightforward and simple. If you can,
avoid using too much industry jargon. Remember that concepts like 'debugging', 'refactoring' or 'code style' are
not something beginners are familiar with. If you find yourself needing to use them, explain those concepts simply, and add in an anecdote (Example: Explain a recent bug you had to fix at work)
