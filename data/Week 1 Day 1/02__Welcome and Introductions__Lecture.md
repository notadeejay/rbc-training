Day 1 Lecture

## Teacher Notes

- The point of this lecture is to make sure students feel comfortable and excited about learning code. Remember this might be a step WAY out of a student's comfort zone. Keep explanations straight forward and simple. If you can,
avoid using too much industry jargon. Remember that concepts like 'debugging', 'refactoring' or 'code style' are
not something beginners are familiar with. If you find yourself needing to use them, explain those concepts simply, and add in an anecdote (Example: Explain a recent bug you had to fix at work)


### Overall Tips

- Avoid saying something is 'easy' or 'simple'. Having someone tell you that something
you're struggling with is 'easy' can be very frustrating. Instead, explain it as simply as you can,
and encourage the student.

- If a student is _really_ stuck. Ask them about their job or hobbies. Often there's an analogy that you can make. It
becomes a bit more manageable if you can root it in something they already know.
