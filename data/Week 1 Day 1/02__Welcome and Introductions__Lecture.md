Day 1 Lecture

## Teacher Notes

- The point of this lecture is to make sure students feel comfortable and excited about learning code. Remember this might be a step WAY out of a student's comfort zone. Keep explanations straightforward and simple. If you can, avoid using too much jargon. Remember that concepts like 'debugging', 'refactoring' or 'code style' are not something beginners are familiar with. If you find yourself needing to use them, explain those concepts simply, and add in an anecdote (Example: Explain a recent bug you had to fix at work)

## Things to Cover
- The structure / format of the course
- Expectations
- Ice Breakers
- How to open Chrome dev tools
- How to use Slack
- Where the coffee / bathrooms etc are in the space
- Wireframes
- General concepts of what each language does, e.g. HTML gives you structure


## Out of Scope
- We'll leave the introduction to HTML for the next class, this is mainly a high level introduction into what they can expect over the next couple of weeks.
