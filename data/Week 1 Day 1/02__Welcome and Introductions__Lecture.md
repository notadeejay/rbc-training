## Objectives
At the end of this class, you should be able to:
- Understand the role of a browser with every page (get, render and run).
- Understand the difference between front end (client side), back end (server side & databases) and full stack development
- Understand how to access Chrome DevTools and use them to make changes to websites in their browser

## Teacher Notes

- The point of this lecture is to make sure students feel comfortable and excited about learning code. Remember this might be a step WAY out of a student's comfort zone. Keep explanations straightforward and simple. If you can, avoid using too much jargon. Remember that concepts like 'debugging', 'refactoring' or 'code style' are not something beginners are familiar with. If you find yourself needing to use them, explain those concepts simply, and add in an anecdote (Example: Explain a recent bug you had to fix at work)

## Things to Cover

- How the Web Works 101
