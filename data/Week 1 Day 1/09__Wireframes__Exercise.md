Now that we've got the content of your page ready to go, a great next step is to create **wireframes** for your project. Wireframes are bare bones sketches of what your page is going to look like.

Here are a few examples you can use for inspiration.

They can be dead simple, or have as much detail as you like.

You can use an online tool like, https://mockflow.com/, or a simple piece of paper and a pen is a great way to go.

Either way, we want to start thinking about the different pieces of our web page. So that when we start learning HTML, we have a clear plan for building our resume sites. At this stage, we want to focus on the content and the layout. Colours and fonts will come later.
