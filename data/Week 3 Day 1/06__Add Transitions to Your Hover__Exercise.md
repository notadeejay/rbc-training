Today, we talked about CSS transitions. They can give you control over how an element
changes to a new property when it's in a hover state.


### Tasks
- [ ] Add a transition to the hover on your anchor tags
- [ ] See if you can transition on more than one property

### Tips and Tricks

#### transition

The transition property takes

```css
div {
  transition: [property] [duration] [timing-function] [delay];
}
```

```css
div {
  transition: font-size 2s linear 1s;
}
```

CSS transitions can be triggered by a hover.
