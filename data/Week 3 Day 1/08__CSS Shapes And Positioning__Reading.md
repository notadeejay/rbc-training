As you've seen so far, combining CSS and HTML is pretty powerful. What we've done so far has only
scratched the surface. Another use for CSS and HTML is to create images or icons. Some people have
even made cartoon characters.

## Positioning

The default position of all HTML elements is static.

- **Relative elements** behave the exact same as static, unless you add some extra properties. Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties will allow you to adjust where the element is in the page.

- **Fixed elements** are positioned relative to the viewport (in other words, the browser window). Even if the page is scrolled, an element with a fixed position will always stay in the same place.
Example here.

**Absolute elements** that are positioned absolutely can get pretty tricky. The behave like a fixed element except they position relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. (Any 'positioned' element is simply one that has a position other than static). Think, they are positioned according to the closest parent element that has a position property.
