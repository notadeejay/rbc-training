To deploy your webpage, you'll be using a service called GetForge.

When you're happy with how your site looks and functions on various screen sizes, you're ready to deploy!

## Tasks

We've broken down the tasks for you in several steps here. Follow them to get your site deployed!

Still not quite ready to deploy? If you need some help finishing your website, you can find the code for our example design [here](https://d.pr/FREE/Hntad5)

### Sign up for GetForge

- Navigate to <https://getforge.com/> and sign up for an account


### Create your site

When you log into your GetForge account, you should see a screen like this one:

- Edit the input at the bottom to customize your site's URL
- Click **Create Site**

### Zip up your project

In order to upload your project to GetForge, you need to zip the folder into a file.

- Find your project folder on your computer, and zip it up

If you're unsure how to do this, try searching the web for something like "how to zip a folder on mac/windows/linux" (changing the last keyword to whichever operating system you're using). Or, ask a peer or mentor to lend you a hand!

### Upload the zip

Back on the GetForge website, click the **Upload ZIP** button.

Then, navigate to the URL that you customized earlier. You should see your site at that address!

#### Congrats! You've just launched a website!
