## Teacher Notes

Going to make this day a bit lighter, so we can thoroughly review JavaScript, and give them some time to plan their projects.

- Include a refresher on JavaScript (Review almost all of it.)
- Be sure to also include an introduction to forms.

## More JavaScript

Start the lecture with a review of everything you did on Monday. Again, go slowly and answer their questions. It's likely that after playing around with the language on Monday they will have some questions, or have forgotten some data types. It's okay to take a chunk of this lecture to review.

Focus on reviewing if statements and functions. Those are usually the trickiest concepts to grasp.
