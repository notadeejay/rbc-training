## Objectives

By the end of this class, you should be able to:
- Access and loop over deeply nested data from within a JavaScript object
- Create and manipulate elements on your page with jQuery methods
- Create a grid-like display of data by combining these two actions

## Teacher Notes

- Review event listeners and today is probably a good day to remind them about indentation.
- There are no slides for this lecture, the best practice is to take the examples from today's activities and walk students through them
- Use the sample response for the Weather app provided [here](/b8a54108-626d-4bc9-be27-671f736731f5) to use as an example for students

## Things to Cover

- Explain JSON and why we're starting with dummy data at the TOP of the their file. (Explain that this a learning step and not how it would typically work when a developer is working on a project)
