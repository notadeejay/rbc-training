What is JQuery?

When developers are building a web app or  a website, it’s common that they run into the same problems with each project. In order to solve this, and continue their lazy streak, they’ve developed something called libraries. Usually a few developers will come up with a solution and share it with everyone else, for free!

Libraries are simply code that someone else has written that you can use. Often they make these common problems easier to handle. Query is one of these libraries. It’s a collection of JavaScript functions written to make common tasks a lot easier.

So, how does it work?

To use JQuery in your project, you need to follow a few steps.

1. Include Jquery library in your project.
2. Add a JavaScript file to your project
3. Require your new JavaScript files in your HTML
4. Start writing JQuery!
Add notes or a diagram about how JQuery needs to be loaded before your custom JS file

Once you’ve added jQuery to your project.
