Next class we'll be taking the user input and using it to send a request to a server. To prepare for that, we're going to start by logging out the user input to our console.

## Tasks

- Add code so that when the user performs a search, the content of the search input is logged to the console

## jQuery and JavaScript reference

#### val

Will return the value of an element:

```javascript
$('p').val()
```

#### console.log

Will print a value to the console:

```javascript
console.log("Hello World")
```
