Before we start writing JavaScript in our new JQuery project. We need to discuss
how to add JavaScript to your HTML.

Remember that the `<head>` of your HTML document is where we put any information
the browser needs to render properly. To add JavaScript to your project, we use a
`<script>` tag in the `<head>` of the document.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="./index.js"></script>
```
