CodePen (<http://codepen.io>) is a great place to practice writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We can also tell it to include jQuery in our pens.

To add jQuery to CodePen:

- Click the **Settings** icon in the JavaScript editor
- Open the **Quick-add selector**
- Choose jQuery
- Hit **Save & Close**
- Write jQuery!

If you're unsure of how to implement something in your project, trying it out first in a CodePen can help you focus on the problem you're trying to solve, without worrying about the rest of the code. Try it out next time you get stuck!
