So far, our page is fairly basic. We have a form and a results div that are shown and hidden.
Take a moment to start filling out the rest of the page. It's helpful to make a quick sketch of
what you would like your page to look like before you start writing code. Think back to the project planning
you did for your HTML and CSS project, the same process will be helpful here.

## Tasks
- Add a Header with the title of your page
- Add a footer
- Add a custom font (https://fonts.google.com/)
- Start adding a color scheme to your project (https://coolors.co/)
- Ajust the layout using your flexbox skills
