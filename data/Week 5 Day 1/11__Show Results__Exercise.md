## Tasks

- Add a div to your HTML that will hold the results of your search
- Add code to show your new results div when your form is submitted
- Add animations to your elements that are being shown and hidden


## jQuery reference

#### hide

Will set the `display` property of an element to `none`, hiding it from the user.

```javascript
$('.box').hide(500)
```

#### show

Will make an element visible by restoring its `display` property to its original value.

```javascript
$('.box').show(500)
```

#### jQuery Animations

jQuery provides us with some methods that let us animate an element being shown and hidden on the page. Some commons ones are:

- slideUp
- slideDown
- fadeOut
- fadeIn
